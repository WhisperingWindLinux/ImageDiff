This is an alpha version of the application, and bugs and memory leaks are possible.

ABOUT

This application allows you to work with 8-bit-per-channel RGB images. Users can open two images and compare them by switching between them using the S key. Additionally, various image processing algorithms and automatic comparison tools based on specific metrics can be applied.

TWINPIX.APP IS DAMAGED AND CAN'T BE OPENED. YOU SHOULD MOVE IT TO THE BIN

When an application is downloaded from a source that Apple does not deem trustworthy, it is assigned an extended attribute called "com.apple.Quarantine." This causes the error message to appear: "<application> is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin."

To resolve this, you can remove the attribute, allowing the application to open.

Simply open a terminal and enter the following command:

xattr -c <path/to/TwinPix.app>
