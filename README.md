# TwinPix

This application allows you to work with 8-bit-per-channel RGB images. Users can open two images and compare them by switching between them using the S key. It is also possible to open a single image and analyze it. Additionally, various image processing algorithms and automatic comparison tools based on specific metrics can be applied.<br/><br/>
The application was tested only on macOS Sonoma 14.1.2 (Apple Silicon M1 Mac), with a 1920x1080 monitor. Kit: Qt 6.8.2 for macOS. <br/>
Builds for platforms other than macOS (Apple Silicon) are not planned at this time.<br/><br/>
<b>This is a beta version of the application, and bugs and memory leaks are possible.</b>
